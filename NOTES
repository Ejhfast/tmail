[ANN] TMail 1.2.3 - Security Update - 4 Apr 2008

TMail is The Mail Handling Library for Ruby!

TMail is the Ruby Mail handler used in the 
Ruby on Rails and Nitro web frame works as
well as many others (now including, the Ruby
Talk mail gateway!).

TMail is now a gem. You can install it on any
platform via:

# gem install tmail

Alternatively you can download the source code
or view extra documentation at the website:

http://tmail.rubyforge.org/


Release Summary:
------------------
This update handles a potential DOS vulnerability on
any host using TMail to handle incomming email; a
crafted email with carefully positioned whitespace
can cause the TMail library to go into an endless
loop causing denial of service attack on email services.

New release handles five tickets in the TMail
tracker as well as more documentation and more
work on the moving Ruby 1.9 Encoding/Decoding Target

Additionally added 7 more test cases to the library
to handle the above tickets.

This should be a drop in replacement for existing
TMail installations - unless you are using TMail on
Ruby 1.9, in which case, you _might_ run into encoding
problems if you are on Ruby 1.9.1, Ruby 1.9 still
works, YMMV, any feedback on TMail on 1.9.1 with
patches is really welcome!


Release Update Details:
-------------------------

* Closed #18881 - TMail goes into an endless loop
if sent an crafted email which puts a whitespace
character at position 78 of the line to be wrapped.

* Closed #19203 - TMail errors in Ruby 1.9.1 on
invalid multibyte chars.

* Closed #18814 - Fixed attchment.rb failing on
mail part that had a nil content-type - now assumes
text/plain as the missing content type and preserves 
the mail structure.

* Closed #18516 - Fixed TMail::Mail#preamble, and
added #preamble=, this allows you now to set and
read the preamble text of an email (the plain text
that appears before any MIME encoded attachments that
you can read in any email client) (Charles Lowe)

* Closed #18515 - Removed ftools from test case
to clean it up (Charles Lowe)
