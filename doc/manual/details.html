<h1>Feature Details</h1>

<h2>Character Encodings</h2>

<p>
I DO NOT support non-Japanese character encodings until
ruby implements M17N functions. It's too complex for me.
</p>

<h2>Header Comments</h2>

<p>
TMail discards ALL comments on converting HeaderField objects
into strings, because I cannot preserve position of comments.
